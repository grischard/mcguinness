						<p>
						On Tuesday, May 18th, 2021, 58-year-old Matthew Jensen was killed in a tragic hit and run crash while crossing McGuinness Boulevard. Mr. Jensen was a resident of North Brooklyn and a dearly beloved ENL teacher at local elementary school PS110. He is remembered as a ray of sunshine who knew the name of every child at the school and taught with light, love, and humor. He adored the PS110 community and was adored by all in return. Hundreds of children are grieving.
						<p>
						The senseless death of Mr. Jensen proves what our North Brooklyn community already knows for more than a decade - McGuinness Boulevard remains one of the most dangerous corridors in Brooklyn and incremental improvements are not working to calm the traffic. In the last five years, 29 pedestrians and 21 cyclists have been injured, with a cyclist killed on the intersection with Norman Avenue in 2019. We need an immediate comprehensive infrastructural redesign to make this roadway safe for everyone. 
						<p>
						Without delay, we are calling on City Hall to make this corridor safe for all users and rebuild the street so cars are forced to drive slower. We demand, at a minimum:
						<ul>
							<li>Wider sidewalks to help pedestrians as they cross the street</li>
							<li>A protected bike lane to protect cyclists and make the street safer for all road users</li>
							<li>Eliminating one lane of traffic in each direction so traffic is slowed and these safety improvements can be installed</li>
						</ul>
						Mr. Jensen's name is added to a long list of tragic deaths and injuries on McGuinness. We can not bring Mr. Jensen back, but we can prevent the next tragedy by acting now to make our neighborhood safer.
